	"content": "Measuring Accuracy for Rule-Based or Machine Learning Matching in AWS Entity Resolution When building systems for data cleaning or record consolidation (entity matching), the critical question is:\nHow do you know if rule-based or ML-based approaches are accurate enough for production deployment?\nThe lack of clear evaluation criteria often causes projects to:\nconsume excessive time, require repeated workflows, or necessitate costly method changes. This article guides you through establishing an objective measurement framework using AWS Entity Resolution, helping evaluate accuracy for both rule-based and machine learning approaches.\n⭐ Key Benefits Clearly define accuracy targets before production deployment. Objective evaluation through ground truth sets, calculating precision, recall, and F1-score. Applicable to both rule-based and ML-based methods, helping select optimal solutions. Access to open datasets (BPID) for experimentation if real data is unavailable. 🧱 Architecture Guide \u0026amp; Key Components Step 1. Understanding \u0026ldquo;ground truth set\u0026rdquo; A ground truth set is a small collection of record pairs manually labeled by humans:\nmatch (identical) no-match (different) Requirements:\nSize is less important than representativeness across scenarios: missing data, input errors, format mismatches, partial duplicates… Must comply with data safety and PII protection standards. Step 2. Key Challenges Real-world data is typically unclean, containing omissions and errors. Need to select appropriate accuracy thresholds — too high is unrealistic, too low carries risk. Priorities vary by industry: High precision in finance \u0026amp; insurance. High recall in marketing \u0026amp; CRM. Step 3. Basic Evaluation Metrics Precision Ratio of pairs the system identifies as \u0026ldquo;match\u0026rdquo; that are actually correct. Recall Ratio of actual matching pairs found by the system. F1-score Harmonic mean between precision and recall. Step 4. Practical Example with BPID Open Dataset AWS provides the BPID dataset (~20,000 synthetic records) containing:\nname email phone number address date of birth complex data scenarios mimicking real-world conditions Implementation Process: Load BPID data. Preprocess data (normalize email, phone, address\u0026hellip;). Run matching workflows with AWS Entity Resolution: rule-based ML-based Compare results against ground truth to calculate: True Positive False Positive True Negative False Negative Precision, Recall, F1-score ✨ New Features in the Solution BPID dataset reflects more complex data than typical clean datasets → more realistic evaluation. AWS Entity Resolution supports both rule-based and ML-based matching. Detailed guidance provided for: preprocessing running matching calculating F1-score 🚀 Deployment \u0026amp; Migration Strategy 1. Build Internal Ground Truth Set If labeled real data is unavailable, create a small ground truth from production data. Include many edge cases. 2. Parallel Testing Run rule-based and ML-based to compare: accuracy cost speed security maintainability 3. Set Acceptance Thresholds Define minimum precision/recall levels suitable for your industry. Examples: Finance: prioritize high precision to avoid false matches. Marketing: prioritize high recall to expand customer base. 4. Use Synthetic Data When Real Data is Limited When facing privacy concerns or data unavailability → use BPID for experimentation. ✅ Conclusion Measuring matching accuracy is essential to:\nensure systems handle difficult cases, avoid wasted time from post-deployment fixes, establish clear standards when comparing multiple solutions or providers. AWS Entity Resolution provides:\npowerful tools, BPID sample dataset, standard evaluation procedures, → helping you verify and select optimal methods for your data. 👤 About the Authors Travis Barnes Senior Product Manager, Technical at AWS Entity Resolution.Over 10 years of experience in identity and adtech, focused on data onboarding and identity resolution solutions.\nYefan Tao Senior Applied Scientist, specializing in entity resolution systems and information retrieval.Researches and implements large-scale ML algorithms, focused on governance and complex data processing.\n"

	"content": "Introduction to Automated Remediation Automated Remediation is the use of software and logical rules to detect and fix infrastructure issues without human intervention. They are critical components for building \u0026ldquo;self-healing\u0026rdquo; systems that minimize service downtime. Computing resources running in production may encounter unexpected issues (such as memory overflow, application crashes). Through the combination of Amazon CloudWatch (monitoring) and AWS Systems Manager (execution), the system can automatically respond to these issues immediately instead of waiting for engineers to handle them manually. Workshop Overview In this workshop, you will deploy a completely automated monitoring and issue remediation process.\nWeb-Server-Test is an EC2 Instance resource that acts as a test application server. A CloudWatch Agent has been installed and configured within this instance to collect memory (RAM) metrics – a metric not monitored by default by AWS. You will use the stress tool to simulate a memory overflow attack, causing the server to become unresponsive. EventBridge \u0026amp; Systems Manager simulate an automated operations team. A Rule is configured to listen for alerts from CloudWatch. When memory exceeds the safe threshold, the system will automatically trigger a restart command (Reboot) on the instance through Systems Manager Automation. This mechanism simulates rapid service recovery in real-world environments. In this workshop, we perform the Reboot action to see results immediately, but for production workloads, you can configure more complex procedures such as dumping RAM for error analysis before restarting or replacing instances with Auto Scaling.

	"content": "IoT-Based Alcohol Violation Detection System A Secure AWS Serverless Solution with Biometric Authentication and DevSecOps 1. Executive Summary This project develops a comprehensive IoT–Cloud platform to monitor and record alcohol concentration violations.\nThe system is composed of two major components:\nDedicated Edge Device: Used by authorized officers, requiring fingerprint (hybrid) authentication before operation. The fingerprint SlotID is verified against a data pool (DynamoDB) on the cloud to unlock the device. Public Web Portal: A web interface that allows anyone to view dashboards and search for their violation history using National ID (CCCD). The backend is fully serverless. The frontend CI/CD workflow is automated using AWS Amplify, while backend infrastructure is managed using Terraform (IaC) and deployed through AWS CodePipeline, following DevSecOps best practices.\n2. Context and Solution The Problem The current manual inspection process contains several critical weaknesses in terms of authentication, transparency, and data management.\nLack of Accountability: The system does not have any mechanism to verify the identity of the operating personnel (who conducted the inspection?). This leads to potential misuse of equipment, procedural errors, and a lack of responsibility when incidents or complaints occur. Lack of Transparency: Citizens who have undergone an inspection have no official, fast, and reliable channel to verify or review their violation records. Fragmented and Unsearchable Data: Violation data (if recorded) is often stored in scattered logbooks or separate Excel files, without centralized management. This makes it nearly impossible—or extremely time-consuming—to look up a person’s violation history (e.g., by national ID number). As a result, it wastes resources and undermines public trust. Proposed Solution This system provides a secure, transparent, and automated enforcement platform by:\nOperator Authentication: Using fingerprint sensors integrated with AWS IoT Core to ensure only authorized personnel can unlock the device. Auditing: Every violation is automatically tagged with the operator’s ID for accountability. Centralized Data Management: Violation data is transmitted via IoT Core, processed by AWS Lambda, and stored in DynamoDB. Public Lookup Portal: A public website built with Amplify + CloudFront, with all API endpoints protected by AWS WAF. Automated CI/CD Pipelines: Frontend CI/CD using Amplify (connected to GitHub). Backend CI/CD using CodePipeline and Terraform. Key Benefits:\nImproved transparency and reduced human error. Fast deployment with low operational cost (~14–16 USD/month). Fully compliant with DevSecOps standards. 3.

Violation Recording: Once unlocked → Measure alcohol level → If exceeded → Input CCCD → Send violations/new → IoT Core → Lambda ProcessViolationFunction → Save to DynamoDB. Public Web Interface: SPA (React/Vue) using Amplify libraries communicates with API Gateway. 4. Technical Implementation Plan Phase Duration Key Tasks Design \u0026amp; IaC Week 1–2 Finalize architecture, write Terraform scripts Firmware (ESP32) Week 3–4 Implement authentication and violation reporting Backend Week 5–7 Develop Lambda functions, IoT Core, and API Gateway Frontend Week 8–9 Build the web UI with React + Amplify CI/CD \u0026amp; Security Week 10–12 Configure pipelines, WAF, and CloudWatch monitoring 5.

The article highlights four key principles: (1) centralized observability through shared AMP workspaces, (2) monitoring quotas and usage with CloudWatch, (3) enforcing label-based active series limits to isolate noisy workloads, and (4) governance at label-set granularity. AMP provides managed collectors, CloudWatch integration, and fine-grained label-based controls, ensuring mission-critical workloads are protected from misconfigured or runaway agents. These capabilities improve cost predictability, enforce metric hygiene, and maintain stable ingestion performance at scale. Real-world outcomes show enterprises reduced overload risks, simplified multi-account collection, improved visibility into cost drivers, and shielded production services from test workloads.\n"

	"content": "Overall Evaluation 1. Working Environment\nThe working environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always willing to help whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, I think it would be nice to have more social gatherings or team bonding activities to strengthen relationships.\n2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin\nThe mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don’t understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports administrative tasks, provides necessary documents, and creates favorable conditions for me to work effectively. I especially appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving the answer.\n3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major\nThe tasks I was assigned align well with the knowledge I learned at university, while also introducing me to new areas I had never encountered before. This allowed me to both strengthen my foundational knowledge and gain practical skills.\n4. Learning \u0026amp; Skill Development Opportunities\nDuring the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared valuable real-world experiences that helped me better plan my career path.\n5. Company Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit\nThe company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still keeps things enjoyable. When there are urgent projects, everyone works together and supports one another regardless of their position. This made me feel like a real part of the team, even as an intern.\n6. Internship Policies / Benefits\nThe company provides an internship allowance and offers flexible working hours when needed. In addition, having the opportunity to join internal training sessions is a big plus.\nAdditional Questions What did you find most satisfying during your internship? What do you think the company should improve for future interns? If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not? Suggestions \u0026amp; Expectations Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience? Would you like to continue this program in the future? Any other comments (free sharing): "
